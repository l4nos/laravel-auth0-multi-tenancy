	Laravel Auth0 Multi Tenancy Management 
</h1>

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION YET

 ## Intro

This package was built to sit alongside the main auth0 package. Unfortunately that package has limited management API capabilities / facades. This package aims to remedy that.

##### If anyone from Auth0 wishes to merge this extra functionality into the main package, please feel free to fork and extract what you need, all I ask is to be credited.

## Documentation

Documentation will be written once all the facades have been built. I will try to mirror the naming conventions of the API docs as much as possible.
